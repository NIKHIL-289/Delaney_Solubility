# ðŸ§ª Delaney_Solubility Prediction Model

Delaney Solubility Prediction Model
A simple AI model that predicts the aqueous solubility (logS) of organic molecules using molecular structure input in the form of SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System). This model is inspired by the dataset from Delaney (2004) and serves as a lightweight chemical property predictor using machine learning.

ðŸ“Œ Features
- Input: Molecular structure as SMILES
- Output: Predicted aqueous solubility (logS)
- Model type: Random Forest / Linear Regression (depending on your code)
- Features: RDKit-generated molecular descriptors
- Dataset: Delaney solubility dataset (2004)

ðŸ§ª Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- RDKit
- joblib
